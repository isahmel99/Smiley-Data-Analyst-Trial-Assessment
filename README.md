# Smiley-Data-Analyst-Trial-Assessment

This GitHub repository holds work I did for a job assessment. It is an analysis of sales, sales calls, market and customer (fictitious) data for a (fictitious) real estate company called Smiley Real Estate.

The files in this repository are:

- Best Agent by Market.csv : This csv file contains the best agent by market.

- Data Analyst Trial Assessment : This is the document with my analysis for the assessment. There are two files: Word and PDF.

- Smiley.twbx : This is a packaged Tableau workbook that contains my analysis of the data.
